Welcome to my project!

A link to the hosted version.

This project is an api api build for the purpose of accessing application data programatically, to mimic the building of a real world backend service (such as Reddit) which should provide this information to the front end architecture.

Clear instructions of how to clone, install dependencies, seed local database, and run tests.

You will also have to creat to .env files: 

1. Create two new files: .env.test and .env.development 
2. Into each, add PGDATABASE=, with the correct database name for that environment. Refer to the setup.sql if unsure on the database names.
3. Add the two new .env files to the .gitignore file. 

The minimum version of Node.js needed to run this project is >=6.0.0.
