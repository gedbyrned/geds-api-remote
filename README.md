If you wish to run the project locally, after cloning the project, ensure that:

1. Create two new files: .env.test and .env.development 
2. Into each, add PGDATABASE=, with the correct database name for that environment. Refer to the setup.sql if unsure on the database names.
3. Add the two new .env files to the .gitignore file.
